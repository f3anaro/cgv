Basics</h1>
<p>The framework consists of several base libraries with the prefix cgv, a standard cgv_viewer and several plugins that can be loaded when starting the viewer by specifying them in the command line arguments. All plugin interfaces and the registration is handled by the cgv libraries.</p>
<p>The cgv libraries (dependencies) are</p>
<ul>
<li>cgv_os ... basic operating system support (threads, sockets)</li>
<li>cgv_signal ... signal mechanism and binding of functions to signals</li>
<li>cgv_utils ... helps to work with files and text and has functionality to parse text</li>
<li>cgv_type (cgv_utils) ... standardized type declaration and type reflection support</li>
<li>cgv_reflect (cgv_utils/type) ... mechanism to reflect types in C++</li>
<li>cgv_data (cgv_utils/type) ... data management such as smart pointers and data views</li>
<li>cgv_base (cgv_data/type/utils) ... registration mechanism, communication and hierarchical structures</li>
<li>cgv_math (cgv_base/type/utils) ... large collection of mostly templated math functions and solvers</li>
<li>cgv_media (cgv_base/data/type/utils) ... support for fonts, images, video and 3D data</li>
<li>cgv_gui (cgv_media/base/data/type/utils) ... abstraction of gui</li>
<li>cgv_render (cgv_gui/media/base/data/type/utils) ... rendering support with OpenGL specialization</li>
</ul>
<p>Deprecated is the cgv library that includes all of the above components in one library.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="platforms"></a>
Supported Platforms</h1>
<p>Currently the following system configurations are supported</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows XP / Vista<ul>
<li>Microsoft Visual Studio<ul>
<li>Visual Studio 2005 (abbreviated by vs8)</li>
<li>Visual Studio 2008 (abbreviated by vs9)</li>
<li>Visual Studio 2008 Express (abbreviated by vs9e)</li>
<li>Visual Studio 2010 (abbreviated by vs10)</li>
<li>Visual Studio 2013 (abbreviated by vs12)</li>
<li>Visual Studio 2015 (abbreviated by vs14)</li>
<li>Visual Studio 2017 (abbreviated by vs141)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Linux<ul>
<li>gcc is in preparation</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Under windows all compilers can be used at the same time. The postfix "_8", "_9", "_9e", "_10", "_12", "_14", "_141" is used for applications and libraries to distinguish the versions. For example "cgv_viewer_12.exe" loads "cgv_12.dll" and "cgv_viewer_14.exe" loads "cgv_14.dll" on startup.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="configs"></a>
Configurations</h1>
<p>For building libraries, plugins, and applications there are four configurations, which are distinguished by extending the compiler postfix. In the following list the cgv internal name of the configuration is given followed by configuration name in vs14 and the full name of the cgv dll with all postfixes that are used in the same way for all other libraries and applications</p>
<ul>
<li>shared release (Release Dll) cgv_14.dll</li>
<li>shared debug (Debug Dll) cgv_d14.dll</li>
<li>static release (Release) cgv_s14.dll</li>
<li>static debug (Debug) cgv_ds14.dll</li>
</ul>
<p>The build system also allows to build an executable from a plugin which is then typed application_plugin. In this case there are two more build configurations "Release Exe" and "Debug Exe", which both build a statically linked executable. The project of an application_plugin must have an application - typically the cgv_viewer - as dependent project. The source files of the dependent application project are added to the project of the application_plugin and built only in the "Exe"-configurations.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="plugins"></a>
Plugins</h1>
<p>A plugin can register instances or factories of newly implemented classes. The new classes are derived from interface class declared in the cgv libraries as for example <a class="el" href="a00236.html">cgv::render::drawable</a>. Registration is typically done in the constructor of a static dummy variable of special template types that do nothing else but register an object or a factory. When the plugin is compiled to a dll the registration code is executed when the dll is loaded.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="directories"></a>
Directory Tree</h1>
<p>The framework is managed in a svn repository located at <a href="https://cgv.inf.tu-dresden.de/svn/cgv/release">https://cgv.inf.tu-dresden.de/svn/cgv/release</a> . It consists of the following tree of sub directories:</p>

<h1><a class="anchor" id="viewer"></a>
Usage of the cgv_viewer</h1>
<p>The cgv_viewer can load plugins after start up. It parses the command line arguments with the help of the function <a class="el" href="a00684.html#a2149df336157ff36461d13373039603f" title="process the command line arguments: extract program name and load all plugins ">cgv::base::process_command_line_args</a> declared in the header <a class="el" href="a00587_source.html">cgv/base/register.h</a>. This function simply calls the <a class="el" href="a00684.html#af69141c3f97899795189e9759ff717f9" title="process a command given by a command info structure, return whether command was processed correctly ...">cgv::base::process_command</a> function for each argument. The command syntax is explained in the documentation of this function.</p>
<p>A plugin can register objects, object factories and registration listeners. Object and factory registration events are delayed until all plugins have been read. Then all registration events are sent to all registered listeners, such that the order in which the plugins are read is not important.</p>
<p>After startup the viewer provides a main menu that can be extended by the plugins, a 3d view and a tab group with guis for registered object instances, which is only shown if there is at least one registered object instance that provides a gui.</p>
<p>In the main menu the item "new" is meant for entries of factories that create new object instances. A factory can be tagged singelton, in which case only one instance can be created. There is also a shortcut assigned to each factory, for example &lt;Ctrl-Q&gt;. If pressed, a new object instance is created. In case of a singelton factory, pressing the shortcut again will toggle visibility of the object instance in the 3d view and select its gui in the tab group of guis.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="configFiles"></a>
Configuration Files</h1>
<p>The registration facility and the property interface of the cgv framework as described on page <a class="el" href="a00006.html">Namespace cgv::base</a> is exploited to support configuration files. A configuration file is passed to the viewer with the command syntax config:"file_name". The use of quotes is important when the file path contains spaces. To add the config command line argument in a project file use the <code>addCommandLineArgs</code> define (see <a class="el" href="a00002.html#makegen">Makefile Generation</a>).</p>
<p>Config files are user specific and should therefore not be checked into the svn repository. Therefore, a twofold strategy is realized based on a default config file and a user specific. The default file is checked into the svn repository and has the extension <code>".def"</code>. It will be specified in -c config:-commands to the viewer and is always available from the svn repository. The user can copy the default file into a file with the same name but the extension <code>".cfg"</code> and specify his user specific configuration there. The viewer will first check for the existence of the <code>".cfg"</code> file and if present read this instead of the default file.</p>
<p>The syntax of the config file is very simple. Lines that start with a <code>'/'</code> are comments. Empty lines are ignored. Lines that contain configuration information are processed with the <a class="el" href="a00684.html#af69141c3f97899795189e9759ff717f9" title="process a command given by a command info structure, return whether command was processed correctly ...">cgv::base::process_command</a> function. Let us explain the most important commands with a simple example config file </p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">/ <span class="keyword">this</span> is a comment</div>
<div class="line">show all</div>
<div class="line"></div>
<div class="line">name(cgv 3d viewer):x=4;y=30;w=1024;h=768</div>
<div class="line">type(graphical_text_interpreter):x=1032;y=30;w=592;h=768</div>
<div class="line">name(gti):file_name=<span class="stringliteral">&quot;D:\Projects\project\gti\examples\examples.dcr&quot;</span></div>
<div class="line"></div>
<div class="line">persistent</div>
<div class="line">name(stereo interactor):view_dir_x=?;view_dir_y=?;view_dir_z=?</div>
<div class="line"></div>
<div class="line">initial</div>
<div class="line">name(stereo interactor):extent=2</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p>There are two possibilities to address registered objects in a config file:</p>
<ul>
<li>by name ... with the syntax <code>name(gti)</code> followed by a colon. This is supported only for objects derived from <a class="el" href="a00037.html">cgv::base::named</a> and the name is matches against <a class="el" href="a00037.html#a4a2ce2091645aa41c8bc594150f10107" title="return the parent node ">cgv::base::named::get_name()</a>.</li>
<li>by type ... with the syntax <code>type(graphical_text_interpreter)</code> followed by a colon. This makes sense only for singleton objects. The type is matched against <a class="el" href="a00017.html#a43c9a44f9129981525fcac04c3d67312" title="overload to return the type name of this object. By default the type interface is queried over get_ty...">cgv::base::base::get_type_name()</a>. The rest of each line after the colon, a semicolon separated list of member assignments follows. This is passed to the <a class="el" href="a00017.html#afbfaded48bb322a4b77350ca73c9e1a2" title="set several properties ">cgv::base::base::multi_set()</a> method. Strings can be enclosed with single or double quotes. If a quote is part of the string, one can use the backslash as escape character. A backslash is either referenced by a double backslash inside a quoted string or if not followed by the enclosing quote symbol, also by a single backslash - as for example in the file name assignment in the above sample.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are two modes to set members of registered objects in the config file:</p>
<ul>
<li>initial ... the value is set once when the config file is read</li>
<li>persistent ... the value is set when the config file is read and the config file is updated whenever the value is changed. This allows to make the current values of selected members persistent over several runs of the application. Only members that are reflected inside the cgv::base::self_reflect method are supported for persistent configuration. At the beginning of a config file the default mode is <code>initial</code>. The special config file lines <code>persistent</code> and <code>initial</code> change the mode for the successive entries of the config file. When a member is configured persistently and the question mark <code></code>? is assigned to a member, the initial value set by the application is kept and written to the config file after the first run of the application.</li>
</ul>
<p>The line <code>"show all"</code> is a special command that will cause the viewer to print out all registered objects and their properties to the console window. In this way one can find out all objects that can be configured. </p>
